# ElectroShare

is an app that allows you to transfer files across local area networks (LAN) and wide area networks (WAN) (WAN functionality is still being tested).

It is a command line application designed for file sharing on LAN networks. To use it, simply open your Windows Shell (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and call the application.

The application itself will provide guidance on how to proceed. Please note that ElectroShare is not a GUI application. If you click on its icon, nothing will happen. Instead, use it through the shells in your operating system.

The source code will be published soon after undergoing tests.
